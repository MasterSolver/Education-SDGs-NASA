        <h2>Indian Education System</h2>
        <p>The Indian education system is vast and diverse, reflecting the country's cultural and regional variations. It consists of several key components:<br></p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p><b>Pre-Primary Education:</b> This includes nursery and kindergarten, aimed at children aged 3 to 6 years, focusing on basic skills and socialization.<br>
            
            <b>Primary Education:</b> Typically for ages 6 to 14, primary education is divided into two stages:<br>
            
            <b>Elementary Education:</b> Classes 1 to 8, providing foundational knowledge in subjects like mathematics, science, languages, and social studies.<br>
            <b>Secondary Education:</b> Classes 9 to 10, which prepares students for board examinations and higher secondary education.<br>
            <b>Higher Secondary Education:</b> Classes 11 and 12, offering specialized streams like Science, Commerce, and Arts, preparing students for university entrance exams.<br>
            
            <b>Higher Education:</b> Universities and colleges offer undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in various fields. The system includes professional courses in engineering, medicine, law, and business.</p>
            
            <h2>Governance</h2>
            <p>The education system is managed by both central and state governments, with various boards of education (like CBSE, ICSE, and state boards) overseeing curricula and examinations.</p>
            
            <h2>Curriculum</h2>
            <p>curriculum emphasizes rote learning, though there is a growing movement towards experiential and skill-based education. The National Education Policy (NEP) aims to promote holistic and multidisciplinary learning.</p> 
            
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p><b>Quality Disparities:</b> There are significant disparities in the quality of education between urban and rural areas.<br>
            <b>Access and Inclusivity:</b> While enrollment rates have improved, issues like dropout rates, especially among marginalized groups, remain a challenge.<br>
            <b>Infrastructure:</b> Many schools lack adequate facilities, teaching materials, and trained staff.</p>
            <h2>Innovations</h2>
            <p>Efforts are being made to incorporate technology in education, with initiatives promoting online learning and digital resources, especially highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            
            <h2>Cultural Aspects</h2>
            <p>Education in India often emphasizes respect for teachers and the importance of education for social mobility. Extracurricular activities and cultural education also play vital roles.<br>
            
            Overall, the Indian education system is a complex blend of traditional values and modern challenges, striving for improvement and adaptation in a rapidly changing world.</p>
